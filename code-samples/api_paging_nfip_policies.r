# The following R code was created to download a full set of data based on one set of criteria. 
#   It was done like this because sometimes users have trouble paging through 60+ million records.
#   So, this breaks the request into more managable, roughly equal chuncks. If you really need
#   the full Policies file, the better approach is to download from the following URL:
#       https://www.fema.gov/about/reports-and-data/openfema/FimaNfipPolicies.csv
# 
#	To download the NFIP policies full file using a paging technique, either modify this code 
#   to cycle through the below filters, or run the code once, changing the filter each time. 
#   Also the default code was written to get data in a json format (this is faster to process 
#   than csv, but more data to download) and save it as an R rds file. Change to what you want.
#
# The filter line that will have to be changed is when the record count is retrieved and also inside
#	the loop where each paging call is performed.
#

# As of 5/3/2021, here are API criteria along with record counts for the NFIP Policies data set:
# $filter=policyEffectiveDate lt '2010-07-01'						--7,329,017
# $filter=policyEffectiveDate ge '2010-07-01' and policyEffectiveDate lt '2012-01-01'	--7,666,149
# $filter=policyEffectiveDate ge '2012-01-01' and policyEffectiveDate lt '2013-07-01'	--7,257,774
# $filter=policyEffectiveDate ge '2013-07-01' and policyEffectiveDate lt '2015-01-01'	--7,221,958

# Paging example in R. Receiving data in JSON, saving in RDS - a single R object.

require("httr")         # wrapper for curl package - may require installation

# This is a simple JSON parser library (may require installation), but since we are not 
#   really doing JSON manipulation to get the data, this is not needed.
#require("jsonlite") 

# There is now an option to retrieve data without using pagination. The new $allrecords flag forces all records to be
#   returned as part of a download rather than the maximum return limit in order to simplify the download of large sets of data. By
#   default, queries with more results than specified by $top will require pagination. By adding $allrecords=true you can override 
#   this behavior. For more information read openfema-samples/analysis-examples/API_Tutorial_Part_3_PagingToGetData.ipynb
