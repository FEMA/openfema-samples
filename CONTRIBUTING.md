## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the OpenFEMA project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

_I think it is important to add a "code of conduct" and possibly an "open source" policy here_

If you have any questions, please [send us an email](mailto:openfema@fema.dhs.gov).
