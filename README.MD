# OpenFEMA Samples

This repository contains code, dataset, and analysis samples that utilize the OpenFEMA API as a data source. This will provide an additional mechanism for the public and FEMA's Whole Community partners to collaborate with FEMA. Each folder contains a README file with additional information.

## OpenFEMA

FEMA collects data on multiple aspects of emergency management—Disaster Information, Individual Assistance, Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), Emergency Management, Preparedness, and Grants. OpenFEMA is the public’s resource for this data. OpenFEMA’s mission is to promote a culture of Open Government within FEMA and increase transparency, participation, and collaboration among the Whole Community in support of FEMA’s mission of helping people before, during, and after disasters.

See the [OpenFEMA website](https://www.fema.gov/open) to access dataset downloads and the application programming interface (API) that provides data in an easily digestible, machine readable format.
