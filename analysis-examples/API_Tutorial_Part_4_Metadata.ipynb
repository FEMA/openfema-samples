    "# OpenFEMA API Tutorial: Part 4 - Metadata\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Quick Summary\n",
    "- This tutorial explains and demonstrates the use of the special OpenFEMA metadata API endpoints. \n",
    "- These endpoints can be useful in accessing data about OpenFEMA datasets such as the last time a dataset was refreshed.\n",
    "- OpenFEMA metadata conform to specifications to promote the standardization of metadata.\n",
    "- Several examples are presented to:\n",
    "  - List all active OpenFEMA (Non-Deprecated) Datasets\n",
    "  - List Deprecated Datasets\n",
    "  - Get Basic Dataset Overview\n",
    "  - Identify a Dataset's Primary Keys\n",
    "  - Check for Updates to a Dataset\n",
    "  - Produce Valid Data Definition Language (DDL) to Create a Database Table\n",
    "  - List Codes for a Dataset, Dataset Field, and Dataset Value\n",
    "- The next couple tutorials will cover basic data analysis, graphing, and mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In previous tutorials, we touched on metadata that is returned with a dataset query. While that metadata describes the call (e.g., the criteria used, fields returned, date run) and sometimes returns messages about the dataset (e.g., deprecation information), the metadata presented in this tutorial describes the dataset itself (e.g., description, update frequency, field definitions). The dataset webpages on fema.gov/open display some of this information, but there are other data that are only available through the metadata endpoints ([OpenFemaDataSets](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/openfema-data-sets-v1) and [OpenFemaDataSetFields](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/openfema-data-set-fields-v1)). Some of the metadata items were included to conform to [DCAT-US Schema v1.1 (Project Open Data Metadata Schema)](https://resources.data.gov/schemas/dcat-us/v1.1/). This is the standard used by the [Data.gov](https://www.data.gov/) project to harvest and aggregate metadata from various federal agencies. Data.gov acts as a public, central repository for federal data *(metadata only, not the actual datasets)* and is essentially a discoverability tool. Further, the OpenFEMA metadata schema also aligns nicely with the [Dublin Core Metadata Initiative](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/), another specification to promote the standardization of metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metadata endpoints can be used to find information about the datasets, such as getting a list of all OpenFEMA datasets that are not deprecated. In addition, the metadata endpoints are especially useful if you are automating access to the datasets or incorporating the API into your own product. Being able to check for updates or dynamically present a field description are good examples of metadata usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the use of these metadata endpoints and to suggest possible use cases. The examples are presented using Python 3, but it should be easy to translate them to almost any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAPI Specification\n",
    "An API specification defines how an API functions and the results to expect when using the API. Usually, API specifications are associated with documentation. They do more however, providing an understanding of API behavior especially with regard to links with other API’s. Specifications define machine-readable interface files for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services. Once defined, tools exist to generate documentation, code stubs, and test cases for a given interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the “official” OpenFEMA API documentation available on fema.gov and the two special metadata endpoints described below, an endpoint has been created to provide an [OpenAPI Specification v3.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.0) file. This format will allow for the experimentation and testing of the OpenFEMA API endpoints directly from a visual interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base path for the OpenAPI metadata endpoint is: https://www.fema.gov/api/open/metadata/v3.0/OpenApi\n",
    "\n",
    "A file type suffix must be added to the base path. Supported file types are:\n",
    " - json – returns data in a JSON format\n",
    " - yaml – returns data in a YAML format\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of use: https://www.fema.gov/api/open/metadata/v3.0/OpenApi.json\n"

    "    <b>Tip:</b> The actual endpoint names are *DataSets* and *DataSetFields*. To clarify that these endpoints provided data about OpenFEMA, the fema.gov dataset page names were prefixed with OpenFema. OpenFemaDataSets and OpenFemaDataSetFields are aliases for the original endpoints. Either may be used. The examples in this tutorial will used the shortened version.\n",

    "The metadata API endpoint that describes each OpenFEMA dataset is: [OpenFemaDataSets](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/openfema-data-sets-v1) (a.k.a. DataSets). This dataset page describes the attributes of the DataSets dataset, including the fields it contains, so we won't list them all here. Many of the attributes are included to conform to with our guiding metadata standards. Some useful attributes include: the dataset name, its version, a description, update frequency, the last update, and deprecation information.\n",

OpenFEMA does add an \"id\" field that can be used to uniquely identify records within one downloaded instance of a dataset. However, this \"id\" is reset when a dataset is fully reloaded (see more detail in the API documentation ([Special Dataset Fields](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/api#Special+Dataset+Fields:~:text=Special%20Dataset%20Fields)).
