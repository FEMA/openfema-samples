    "# OpenFEMA API Tutorial: Part 5 - Getting Dataset Updates\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Quick Summary\n",
    "- This tutorial explains and demonstrates how to check for dataset and record updates for an OpenFEMA dataset. \n",
    "- This is useful as it can minimize bandwidth and computation.\n",
    "- The OpenFEMA API has a special endpoint called \"DataSets\" that contains a lastDataSetRefresh value useful to determine when the dataset was last successfully updated in OpenFEMA.\n",
    "- Many datasets contain a lastRefresh field indicating when the record was last updated or added. This can be used to retrieve only updated data rather than download a full dataset.\n",
    "- A [Final Working Example](#Final-Working-Example) (at the bottom of this document) demonstrates checking a dataset update and retrieving only records added or modified since a previous time.\n",
    "- The next couple tutorials will cover basic data analysis, graphing, and mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In previous tutorials we demonstrated the basic use of the OpenFEMA API, parameters, retrieving more than 10,000 records by making multiple API calls, and metadata usage. This tutorial will demonstrate how to use a special field to retrieve only those records that have been added or changed since your last API call. \n",
    "\n",
    "While some users are engaged in an analysis or study of FEMA data, necessitating a retrieval of a full dataset, other users integrate FEMA data into their own applications or processes. While the most straightforward approach may seem to be downloading the full dataset at some periodic interval, it is possible to download only changes to datasets after an initial download. This reduces the amount of data and time needed to refresh a dataset.\n",
    " \n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to perform periodic updates of data rather than download the full dataset. Important limitations and gotchas are also provided. The examples are presented using Python 3, but it should be easy to translate them to almost any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking for Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Data updates are possible for some datasets and are useful in situations where a full set of historical data is required as well as any data added since the initial download. For the OpenFEMA API, it is important to note the distinction between the dataset being updated or refreshed versus the actual data or records being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Updates\n",
    "The OpenFEMA data store will either reload or update a specific dataset according to a refresh interval based on the data owner’s recommendations, the source systems speed of data processing, the size of the data set, and the complexity of retrieving the data. The refresh interval (expressed as an ISO 8601 Repeating Interval) for each data set varies and can be found on the associated dataset page as the following images illustrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Update Frequency Example 1](img/frequency1_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Update Frequency Example 2](img/frequency2_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A special metadata API endpoint exists to describe each OpenFEMA dataset: [OpenFemaDataSets](https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/openfema-data-sets-v1) (aka. DataSets). The “lastRefresh” element in this dataset indicates when the metadata record was refreshed (i.e., the attributes representing a specific dataset), while the \"lastDataSetRefresh\" element indicates when the dataset _that the metadata record represents_ was last updated in the OpenFEMA data store. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call this endpoint and review some of the elements it returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Tip:</b> To see all the elements this metadata endpoint returns, review the data dictionary on dataset page: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/openfema-data-sets-v1\n",

    "For some datasets, it is possible to retrieve *updated data*, meaning it is possible to identify a record by the date it was changed within an OpenFEMA dataset. If a dataset contains a field called “lastRefresh”, OpenFEMA is receiving and adding updates to the record set, and lastRefresh represents the date when the record was added to or updated in the dataset. Datasets that do not contain this field are refreshed by performing a full reload of all the data; there is no way to tell when an individual record was added or changed. **Note: the lastRefresh date does not represent when the data was modified in the source system, just the date when it changed in the OpenFEMA dataset.** Exceptions may exist. Such exceptions will be documented on the appropriate dataset page.\n",
