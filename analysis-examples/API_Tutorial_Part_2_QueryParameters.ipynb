    "# OpenFEMA API Tutorial: Part 2 - Query Parameters\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Quick Summary\n",
    "- This tutorial demonstrates use of the OpenFEMA API query parameters - *it is not a Python language tutorial*\n",
    "- The OpenFEMA API has a rich set of features that allow data to be filtered, sorted, and integrated into your own apps or automations\n",
    "- An API parameter is a name or keyword that when added to a base query and endpoint will change the endpoint's behavior\n",
    "- Several categories of OpenFEMA API parameters exist: metadata, data limiting, content altering, and data delivery\n",
    "- A [Final Working Example](#Final-Working-Example) demonstrates the use and combination of many of the API parameters using Python\n",
    "- The next tutorial will cover OpenFEMA API \"paging\" - retrieving more than 1,000 records in code using the \\\\$skip and \\\\$top parameters and additional usage examples\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In the previous tutorial we demonstrated the basic use of the OpenFEMA API - declaring a library to facilitate web requests, specifing the endpoint URL, issuing the OpenFEMA API call, and capturing the results. The OpenFEMA API provides many parameters that can be used to alter the nature of the data returned. Some parameters alter the content of the data - the fields to return, the sort order, and *what* records to return based on criteria. Other parameters affect data delivery or *how* the data is returned - file format, file names, and the number of records to return at one time. Finally, some parameters are used to alter the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate the use of the most common OpenFEMA API parameters. Use of these parameters will significantly enhance your experience with the API. The examples are presented using Python 3, but it should be easy to translate them to almost any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a summary and additional examples, please see the [OpenFEMA Documentation](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/api).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an API parameter?\n",
    "An API parameter is simply a name or keyword that when added to a base query and endpoint will change the endpoint's behavior. Parameters can be used for various reasons, such as to insert data into a system, as a switch mechanism to turn things on or off, or to provide instructions to the API to filter returned data based on a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "API parameters are added to the end of the base URL and endpoint call.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample API Call](img/anatomy_of_api_call.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anatomy of an API Query\n",
    "At first glance, the query may seem complicated. Lets take a closer look at the composition of a query string and explain the various components:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sample Query String](img/anatomy_of_query_string.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base URL/Query Separator** - The question mark (?) acts as a separator between the base URL and endpoint and the query or parameter list. Lack of this separator will cause the call to fail.\n",
    "- **Parameter** - The parameter consists of a name, and for OpenFEMA is prefixed with a dollar sign to clearly make a distinction between the parameter and the value that follows. A full list of the parameters offered by OpenFEMA can be found in the [OpenFEMA Documentation](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/api).\n",
    "- **Parameter Name/Value Separator** - A parameter *value* must follow the parameter name. The equals sign (=) separates these two.\n",
    "- **Value** - The instruction or value that is assigned to the parameter. This will vary depending on the context of the parameter.\n",
    "- **URL Encoded Character** - Some characters have special meaning within a URL such as a pound sign (#) or a forward slash (/). Some characters while permitted, such as spaces, can be ambiguous. URL Encoding is used to deal with these problems. Codes are used to represent problematic characters. For example, %20 represents a space and %27 represents a single quote. A web search of \"url encoding\" or \"percent encoding\" will produce a list of the code values for problematic characters.\n",
    "- **Logical Operator** - Optional for many parameters. Some parameters, such as \\\\$filter, need a logical operator for comparison purposes. The equals sign (=) cannot be used as it is currently in use as the Parameter Name/Value Separator. OpenFEMA uses textual values such as \"eq\" for \"equal to\" and \"gt\" for \"greater than\". See the documentation for a list of available operators.\n",
    "- **Parameter Pair Separator** - An API query can use many parameters together. To separate the parameters, the ampersand sign (&) is used. This tells the OpenFEMA API that the previous parameter is terminating and another follows.\n",
    "- **Next Parameter/Value Pair** - Any number of parameters may be used in the same query. **The order in which parameters are combined is not important.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, see the [Wikipedia Query String page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "    <b>Tip:</b> Do not add spaces between the the URL/Query Separator (?), the Parameter name including the dollar sign, the Name/Value separator (=), and the Parameter Pair Separator (&) otherwise the call will fail.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "    <b>Note:</b> There can be slight variation in the notation and symbols used across different web APIs. The notation and examples used here apply to the OpenFEMA API.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why would I want to use API parameters rather than manipulate the full dataset myself?\n",
    "It is true that you can download the full dataset and filter/transform it in a spreadsheet, using code, or your favorite  analytic tool. However, there are a few benefits of taking advantage of the OpenFEMA API parameters:\n",
    " - Reducing the amount of data you need to download. This can reduce download times and eliminate work to filter/transform. This is especially relevant when dealing with very large datasets.\n",
    " - Offload computer processing to someone else's server - OpenFEMA's!\n",
    " - To return data in a format that makes it easier for you to process or ingest.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Calling an OpenFEMA Endpoint with a Parameter\n",
    "Assuming you have identified an endpoint (see [OpenFEMA DataSets](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets)), determine the parameters you wish to apply (we will discuss them later), and add them to the end of the base URL/endpoint - separated with the question mark of course. The resulting URL can be accessed by a browser, by code, or through many third-party analytics applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in part 1 of the tutorial, the process to call an API endpoint is straightforward - declare a library or module that can facilitate requests to web resources, define the URL/API endpoint - now including the parameters (aka, the query, the request) and issue the API call.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example will combine the base url and endpoint with the parameter.\n"
